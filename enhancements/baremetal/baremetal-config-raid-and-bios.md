# Config RAID and BIOS for Baremetal IPI deployments

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Operational readiness criteria is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

This enhancement proposes to add the support of RAID and BIOS configuration for baremetal IPI deployments.

## Motivation

With the new feature of [RAID configuration](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/292) and the upcoming feature of [BIOS configuration](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/302), openshift already has or will have the ability to configure RAID and BIOS for baremetal.

However, these features only work with a running cluster, users cannot configure desired RAID and BIOS during IPI deployments.

### Goals

- Allow users to configure RAID and BIOS in ***install-config.yaml***.
- IPI deployments can handle the configuration of RAID and BIOS.

### Non-Goals

- Add new or vendor specific options regarding RAID and BIOS.

## Proposal

The configuration of RAID and BIOS is finally handed over to Ironic during the IPI deployments.
1. Add two new fields *raid* and *firmware* to *platform.baremetal.hosts* in the [install-config.yaml](https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/data/data/install.openshift.io_installconfigs.yaml) file.
2. Openshift Installer process the field contents into manifests.
3. [Terraform-provider-ironic](https://github.com/openshift-metal3/terraform-provider-ironic) gets the
configuration of RAID and BIOS for master nodes and then passes it to Ironic([Baremetal Operator(BMO)](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator)
has supported the process of RAID and BIOS for worker nodes).

### User Stories

With the addition of this feature, the users can configure RAID and BIOS in IPI deployments.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

#### Add two fields

New *platform.baremetal.hosts* fields called *raid* and *firmware*.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    ...
    hosts:
      - name: master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: IPAddress
          username: UserName
          password: PassWord
        bootMACAddress: MACAddress
        raid: RAIDConfig
        firmware: BIOSConfig
```

RAID feature has been implemented in **BMO**, so the *raid* field here is the same as the [BMH]((https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/399f5ef7ee3831014c1425250bc4fa49641a8709/config/crd/bases/metal3.io_baremetalhosts.yaml)).
The *firmware* field is the same as the *spec.firmware* field in **BMH** which is been advancing by [#302](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/302).

#### Process the fields in installer

For master nodes, call the `BuildTargetRAIDCfg` method in **BMO** to process the *raid* field into *target_raid_config*, and finally write *target_raid_config* into the ***terraform.baremetal.auto.tfvars.json*** file.

For worker nodes, copy *raid* and *firmware* field to **BMH**.

#### Process the fields in terraform-provider-ironic

Add *target_raid_config* and *bios_settings* fields to terraform-provider-ironic API, 
process the two fields by [manual cleaning](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/cleaning.html#manual-cleaning).

### Risks and Mitigations

TBD

## Design Details

### Test Plan

- Unit tests for determining the configuration of RAID and BIOS passed to Ironic meeting expectations.
- e2e tests for determining the configuration of RAID and BIOS configured during the IPI deployments.

### Graduation Criteria

- Supporting the configuration of RAID and BIOS for worker nodes is target for GA in 4.9.
- Supporting the configuration of RAID and BIOS for master nodes is target for GA in 4.10.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Older versions of the installer will ignore the *raid* and *firmware* fields.

## Implementation History

NONE

## Drawbacks

This will increase the number of steps in IPI deployments and take longer.

## Alternatives

Add RAID and BIOS configuration by modifying the manifest files **~/clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts- \*.yaml** generated by executing `openshift-baremetal-install --dir ~/clusterconfigs create manifest`.

This approach takes advantage of already supported features, so it does not need to modify any source code, but it only works for worker nodes.
